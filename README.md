# AIML--Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests

## 📌 Objective
Implement Decision Trees and Random Forests using Scikit-learn to classify heart disease data.

## 🛠 Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset

## ✅ Steps Completed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Trained and visualized a Decision Tree
3. Pruned the tree to avoid overfitting
4. Trained a Random Forest model
5. Compared accuracies
6. Analyzed feature importances
7. Evaluated using cross-validation
